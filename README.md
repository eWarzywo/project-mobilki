# FortTask - Household Management Android App

## üì± Application Overview

FortTask is a comprehensive household management Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app enables families and household members to efficiently organize their daily tasks, manage expenses, coordinate events, maintain shopping lists, and securely store credentials - all in one centralized platform.

> **üìñ Read-Only Application**: This application is currently in read-only mode. Users can view and browse all household data (chores, bills, events, shopping lists) but cannot create, modify, or delete items through the mobile interface. Data modifications are handled through the backend system.

> **üåê Web App Dependency**: This mobile app requires the **FortTask Web Application** for full functionality. The web app serves as the complete management platform where users can create, edit, and delete household data. This mobile app acts as a companion viewer for the web-based system.

**Last Updated**: May 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Target SDK**: Android 34+
